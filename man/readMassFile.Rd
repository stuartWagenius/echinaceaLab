\arguments{
  \item{file}{character filename or filename with path of
  raw mass data file}

  \item{writeCsv}{logical indicating whether to print
  output to csv file (saves automatically to working
  directory)}
}
\value{

\description{
  This function reads the raw mass data files created
  during weighing and edits them into a useful dataframe,
  with the option of saving them as a csv. The function
  creates a list of three dataframes, which is returned
  invisibly. One gives the cleaned-up, edited mass data
  (good). The other two give bad or strange data that may
  be useful for investigating mass files. You have the
  option of saving good records as a csv with the argument
  writeCsv. The writeCsv argument defaults to not writing
  csv file.
