  Reads data files located in the folders
  \url{I:/Departments/Research/GrowthChamber/chamber88} and
  \url{I:/Departments/Research/GrowthChamber/chamber89} and
  generates graphs of temperature, humidity, light, and CO2
  (CO2 in chamber 88 only). Graphs give measured values of
  environmental conditions (black dots) along with the
  values specified on the Conviron System (red dots).
  Graphs also give range and mean of environmental values
  throughout 24 hours. The user may visualize graphs in R
  or save them as a PDF.
